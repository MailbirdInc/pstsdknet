# Boost

Before compiling psdsdknet, the Boost 1.73 (or latest) redist should be downloaded and added to the solution.

1. Download Boost 1.73 from: https://www.boost.org/users/download/
2. Inside the `boost_1_73_0` zip you will have a folder called simply `boost`. Copy that folder inside the solution, under the `pstsdk_0_3_0` folder.
