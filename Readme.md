# Boost

Before compiling the psdsdknet solution, the Boost 1.42 redist should be downloaded and extract inside a folder called "boost".

1. Download Boost 1.42 from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.42.0/
2. Inside the `boost_1_42_0` zip you will have a folder called simply `boost`. Copy that folder inside the solution, under the `pstsdk_0_3_0` folder.
